Simple CRUD functionality
- Designed for you to be able to to view any users videos, but only be able update, and delete your own
Google OAuth
- Uses Google authentication for sign-in abilities. There are no private channels, this is really only designed to limit the ability for users to edit other users video channels. 
Designed for OBS Streaming Software
- After downloading OBS and linking your new stream with the ID of your current stream, you can cast your screen to the player. 
- One limitation of this, is that a user can cast to any ID they choose, which obviously isnt ideal.
